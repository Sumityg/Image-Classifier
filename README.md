# Installation
Pytorch was installed to idenify the images usig transfer learning.Apart from that,there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
# Project Motivation
The purpose of this project was to create an image classifier which could take flower photos and a pre-trained neural network and employ transfer learning in order to classify the different species of flower in the image dataset.
The motivation for this project is to satisfy requirements for Term 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, as well as to practice and demonstrate deep learning skills and transfer learning techniques.
# File Description
There are three notebooks which have been used to perform the task of identifying the images:
- 1)Image Classifier Project.ipynb:In this notebook the model is trained and new image is classiied using the model.
- 2)predict.py:This file contains the script which can be run from the shell to predict the class of the new flower 
- 3)train.py:This file contains the script which can be used to train the image classifier on the available dataset.
