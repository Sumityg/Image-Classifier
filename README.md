# Installation
Pytorch was installed to idenify the images usig transfer learning.Apart from that,there should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
# Project Motivation
The purpose of this project was to create an image classifier which could take flower photos and a pre-trained neural network and employ transfer learning in order to classify the different species of flower in the image dataset.
The motivation for this project is to satisfy requirements for Term 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, as well as to practice and demonstrate deep learning skills and transfer learning techniques.
# File Description
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.This notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
# Licensing,Authors and Acknowledgement
Must give credit to Udacity for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
